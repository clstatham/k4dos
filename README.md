# k4dos
K4DOS is a hobby operating system written in Rust. It current supports x86_64 architecture and aims for Linux ABI compatibility (running unmodified Linux programs).
# Building
I haven't set up a proper build system for this to work on other people's machines yet. Contact me or open a PR if you'd like to help with that.
For now, this repo exists to present the source code to others who might want to learn from it.
